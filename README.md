Project Description

This project focuses on traffic sign detection and recognition using  YOLO.
To achieve this, I created a custom dataset of road traffic signs and trained YOLO on it. The trained model can detect and classify various traffic signs in images with good accuracy.

Main steps of the project:
	•	Building a traffic sign dataset
	•	Training YOLO on the custom dataset
	•	Testing the trained model on real images of road signs
